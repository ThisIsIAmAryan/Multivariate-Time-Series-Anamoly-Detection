## 1. Proposed Solution

### Detailed Explanation
The project delivers a **Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection System** — a comprehensive machine learning solution that analyzes complex industrial process data to identify abnormal patterns and their root causes. The system processes Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) data with 52 features across 26,400 time-series samples to detect anomalies and provide actionable insights for industrial monitoring and predictive maintenance.

The solution provides insights through:
- **Anomaly Detection Engine**: Ensemble model combining Isolation Forest, PCA reconstruction error, and statistical thresholds for robust anomaly identification
- **Feature Attribution**: Identification of top 7 contributing features for each detected anomaly to enable root cause analysis
- **Severity Classification**: Anomaly scoring on a 0-100 scale with severity categorization (Normal, Slight, Moderate, Significant, Severe)
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of anomaly trends, severity distribution, and detailed data exploration
- **Time-Aware Analysis**: Proper temporal data splitting (27.3% training, 72.7% analysis) respecting chronological order
- **Statistical Insights**: Comprehensive performance metrics and data distribution analysis

### Problem Addressed
Industrial process monitoring faces significant challenges in detecting anomalies before they cause system failures or quality issues. Existing systems often lack:
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis** across complex feature spaces
